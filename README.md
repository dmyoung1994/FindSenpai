# FindSenpai
A port of [Find Senpai](www.findsenpai.co) to iOS. It was a hackathon project I did and I really enjoyed making it so now it's my excuse to pick up Swift.
## TODO list
- Senpai packs for in game purchase (maybe even add curency for completing levels to reward people for playing the game) disaproving face
- Safe high score on device and add it to the loss screen
- Randomize speed as well
- Pay to stay on level
- Reach out to people to see if they'll let me use their stuff
- Impliment score system where score on level = (level * 10) and add a reduction for time taken to complete level at certain intervals

### Game Modes
- Timed version of the game that levels expire after a certain time and then you lose\
- Local multiplayer to see who can find senpai first

- 10000 score = 1 senpai token
- 100 senpai tokens = new characters
- 100 senpai tokens = $5
