# FindSenpai
A port of [Find Senpai](www.findsenpai.co) to iOS. It was a hackathon project I did and I really enjoyed making it so now it's my excuse to pick up Swift.
## TODO list
- Senpai packs for in game purchase (maybe even add curency for completing levels to reward people for playing the game)
- Punish picking the wrong senpai with a loss screen "I didn't want you to notice me anyways...b-b-baka" With the senpai's disaproving face
- Safe high score on device and add it to the loss screen
- Randomize speed as well
- Pay to stay on level
- Reach out to people to see if they'll let me use their stuff
- Impliment score system where score on level = (level * 10) and add a reduction for time taken to complete level at certain intervals
- 10000 score = 1 senpai token
- 100 senpai tokens = new characters
- 100 senpai tokens = $5
